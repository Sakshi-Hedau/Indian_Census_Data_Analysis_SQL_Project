**Indian Census Project** 

This project presents an in-depth SQL-based exploratory analysis of Indian census data, focusing on population, literacy, sex ratio, growth, and area-related insights using two datasets. The project demonstrates data extraction, transformation, aggregation, and use of advanced SQL techniques such as joins, window functions, temporary tables, and set operations.

**Tools**: SQL (T-SQL), Microsoft SQL Server, Excel

**Description**
- Performed comprehensive SQL-based analysis on district-level Indian census data to extract insights on population growth, literacy, and sex ratio trends.
- Utilized JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, temporary tables, and RANK() window functions to answer complex analytical questions.
- Identified top and bottom states by average literacy, growth, and sex ratio using aggregation and sorting techniques.
- Estimated male vs. female population using derived columns and sex ratio logic from joined tables.
- Calculated literate vs. illiterate population by merging demographic and population data.
- Evaluated population change from the previous to the current census using calculated fields.
- Analyzed population density by comparing population against area per state.
